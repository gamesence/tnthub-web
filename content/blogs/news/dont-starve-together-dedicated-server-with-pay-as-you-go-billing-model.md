TNTHub is dedicated to offering dedicated game server rental services, designed specifically for gamers. Our unique pay-as-you-go model charges based on the time you use the server, ensuring you only pay for what you need. This means you can turn off the server when you're away, such as when you’re at work, and avoid unnecessary costs, saving you a significant amount of money.

As of August 3, 2024, TNTHub has launched its first service: the Don't Starve Together Dedicated Server. You can now rent a dedicated server for Don’t Starve Together, allowing you to enjoy the fun of building and adventuring with friends.

Join us at TNTHub and experience the ultimate flexibility and affordability in game server rentals. Rent your dedicated server today and embark on an unforgettable gaming adventure with your friends!
